This is the Noisebridge Neurohacking Dreamteam blog. The group began in the Spring of 2013 with the idea to study neuroscience, create art, share dreams and dissect every step along the way.

<!--more-->

Topics of interest include EEG, digital signal processing, neural simulation, machine learning, neuroanatomy, neuro(electro)chemistry, psyops, cellular automata, sleep, open source and the varied stories of participants. 

Join us on Wednesday nights, 8PM, at [2169 Mission Street](https://noisebridge.net) on the third floor at the [collaboration station](https://noisebridge.net/CollaborationStation).

Meetings are open and do not require RSVP. The first half of the meeting is generally dedicated to introductions and sharing of intersts. The second half tends towards research and writing code.

A curated reading list is maintained on the [Noisebridge Wiki](https://noisebridge.net/wiki/DreamTeam/Reading).

A running inventory of materials used, and possibly created, by the group:

* [OpenBCI](http://openbci.com) 8-channel, 24-bit EEG 
* [Brainduino](http://psychiclab.org/IBVA/kit1.html) 2-channel, 24-bit, ultra-low impedence EEG
* [OpenBCI Data Aquisition and Visualization Platform](https://github.com/kevinjos/openbci-golang-server)
* [ANN Trainer](https://github.com/nbdt/gotrain)
